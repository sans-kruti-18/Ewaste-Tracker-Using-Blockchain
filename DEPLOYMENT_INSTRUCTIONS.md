# Deployment Instructions

This document explains how to deploy the smart contracts to Ganache and connect the React frontend.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure Ganache is running
2. Make sure MetaMask is installed and connected to Ganache
3. Truffle is installed globally (`npm install -g truffle`)
4. Node.js is installed

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy the Smart Contracts

```bash
# Navigate to the project root directory
cd "D:\project\ewaste v3"

# Install truffle dependencies
npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider

# Compile the contracts
truffle compile

# Deploy to the local Ganache network
truffle migrate --network development
```

The deployment script will output the addresses of the deployed contracts. Make note of the `UserManagement` and `EWasteTracking` addresses.

Example output:
```
UserManagement: 0x8B3e0a97A34e471E3429a20095458e98451ab9C6
EWasteTracking: 0xc9338c7BDF1507B3EbaC9A9Bc785686cbb8f01EB
RecyclingManagement: 0x...
LogisticsTracking: 0x...
ComplianceAudit: 0x...
```

### 2. Update the Frontend Configuration

You can update the configuration automatically using the provided script:

```bash
# Run the update-config script with the contract addresses
node update-config.js 0x8B3e0a97A34e471E3429a20095458e98451ab9C6 0xc9338c7BDF1507B3EbaC9A9Bc785686cbb8f01EB
```

Or you can manually edit the config.js file in the frontend/src directory:

```javascript
// D:\project\ewaste v3\frontend\src\config.js
const config = {
  contracts: {
    userManagementAddress: "0x8B3e0a97A34e471E3429a20095458e98451ab9C6", // Replace with your UserManagement address
    eWasteTrackingAddress: "0xc9338c7BDF1507B3EbaC9A9Bc785686cbb8f01EB" // Replace with your EWasteTracking address
  }
};

export default config;
```

### 3. Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd "D:\project\ewaste v3\frontend"

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Testing the Blockchain Connection

After setting up, you can test if the application can connect to the blockchain:

1. Start the React application
2. Open your browser's developer console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console)
3. Type `testConnection()` in the console and press Enter
4. Check the console output for connection status

Example successful output:
```
Testing blockchain connection...
✅ Web3 initialized successfully
✅ Connected account: 0x854399CE7C4592921225d24168950ef227EF2166
✅ Connected to network ID: 5777
✅ Contract instances created
✅ UserManagement contract connected. Admin: 0x854399CE7C4592921225d24168950ef227EF2166
✅ EWasteTracking contract connected. Waste counter: 0
✅ Blockchain connection test completed successfully
```

## Using the Application

1. Open MetaMask and ensure it's connected to Ganache
   - Network: Custom RPC with URL http://localhost:7545 (or your Ganache URL)
   - Chain ID: 1337
   - Import accounts using private keys from Ganache

2. Register as a Producer:
   - Connect your wallet when prompted
   - Select "Producer" role
   - You'll be prompted to register if not already registered
   - Approve the transaction in MetaMask

3. Log waste items:
   - Fill out the form with waste details
   - Submit the form and approve the transaction
   - View your logged waste in the list below

## Common Issues

### MetaMask Connection Issues

If you encounter issues connecting MetaMask:
- Make sure MetaMask is unlocked
- Make sure MetaMask is connected to the Ganache network (usually http://localhost:7545)
- Add Ganache accounts to MetaMask by importing their private keys:
  1. Open Ganache and click on the key icon for an account
  2. Copy the private key
  3. In MetaMask, click on your account icon > Import Account
  4. Paste the private key and click Import

### Contract Interaction Issues

If contract interactions fail:
- Check the contract addresses in config.js
- Make sure Ganache is running and the contracts are deployed
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Make sure you have enough ETH in your account for gas

### Transaction Failures

If transactions fail:
- Check gas price and limit in MetaMask settings
- Make sure your account has the correct role for the action
- Check the browser console for specific error messages
